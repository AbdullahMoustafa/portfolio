As a Lead Data Analyst at DataScience Middle East, I worked across various government entities in the UAE, including the Federal Tax Authority (FTA), Dubai Police, and the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP). I led and managed multiple high-impact data projects, overseeing both strategy and execution while coordinating resources across the Gulf region.

The sample shown here highlights part of my work with MOHAP, supporting both public and private sector initiatives aimed at enhancing services for businesses and citizens.
