## Network Weekly Complaint Dashboards/Segmented Weekly Complaints Dashboard
Sample from my work at Telecom Egypt as Sr Data Analyst in Customer Experience Quailty Assurance

As part of my work at Telecom Egypt, I developed two automated dashboards to monitor weekly customer complaints. One provides a weekly trend overview, while the other segments complaints based on customer quota levels for more targeted analysis. These dashboards are shared via email with management and technical teams to support timely actions and improve network service quality.


** Please note : The data presented in these dashboards is simulated and does not reflect actual customer information, in accordance with data confidentiality policies.
